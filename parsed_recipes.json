The result is incredibly light and fluffy pancakes that are perfect for weekend mornings or special occasions.\r\n\r\n## The Story Behind the Recipe\r\n\r\nThis recipe came from my grandmother Rose, who learned it from her mother during the Great Depression. Back then, buttermilk was often available when fresh milk wasn't, and these pancakes became a way to create something special from simple ingredients.\r\n\r\n## Tips for Perfect Pancakes\r\n\r\n- **Temperature matters**: Your griddle should be hot enough that a drop of water sizzles and evaporates quickly\r\n- **Don't press down**: Let the pancakes cook naturally without pressing them with a spatula\r\n- **Fresh baking powder**: Make sure your baking powder is fresh for maximum fluffiness\r\n- **Room temperature ingredients**: Take eggs and buttermilk out 30 minutes before cooking for best results\r\n\r\n## Serving Suggestions\r\n\r\nThese pancakes are delicious with:\r\n\r\n- Pure maple syrup and butter\r\n- Fresh berries and whipped cream\r\n- Honey and chopped nuts\r\n- Apple cinnamon compote\r\n- Crispy bacon or sausage on the side",

      "body": "## Recipe #94: Cranberry Nut Bread Recipe\r\n\r\nOne of the great blessings of living in California is our abundance of produce year round. Walnuts are in season, as are navel oranges. Buy an orange and squeeze it fresh to get the best juice for this recipe (grate the peel first). Frozen cranberries work well, just slice them in half. I've seen suggestions online to pulse the cranberries in a food processor as a way to more easily chop them, but I think you could easily get too many small bits using that method. The best results will come from chopping them yourself, all they need is to be cut in half, just cut a few at a time to keep them from rolling off the table. The result is a tangy, slightly sweet bread with occasional explosions of cranberry tartness, mellowed with walnuts.\r\n\r\n**Ingredients:**\r\n- 2 cups flour\r\n- 3/4 cup granulated sugar\r\n- 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\r\n- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda\r\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\r\n- 3/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts\r\n- 1 cup chopped cranberries\r\n- 3/4 cup orange juice\r\n- 1/4 cup butter, melted\r\n- 1 egg, beaten\r\n- 1 Tbsp grated orange peel\r\n\r\n**Instructions:**\r\n1. Pre-heat oven to 350°F.\r\n2. Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the chopped cranberries and walnuts to coat with the flour mixture.\r\n3. Mix together orange juice, butter, egg, and orange peel. Add to flour, cranberry, nut mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just blended.\r\n4. Pour into a greased 9x5 or 8x4 loaf pan. Bake at 350°F for 55 to 60 minutes or until done (a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean).\r\n5. Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.\r\n\r\n**Serves 8.**",

Preheat the oven to 400°F (convection or regular). Set the salmon on a foil-lined baking sheet skin side down. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\r\n2.

Tyler's Blueberry Scones with Lemon Glaze\r\n\r\n*Recipe courtesy Tyler Florence -- SHOW: Food 911 EPISODE: B&B Breakfast*\r\n\r\n**Total Time: 40 min Prep: 20 min Cook: 20 min Yield: 8 scones -- Level: Easy**\r\n\r\n**Ingredients:**\r\n\r\n**Blueberry Scones:**\r\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\r\n- 1 tablespoon baking powder\r\n- ½ teaspoon salt\r\n- 2 tablespoons sugar\r\n- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold, cut in chunks\r\n- 1 cup fresh blueberries\r\n- 1 cup heavy cream, plus more for brushing the scones\r\n\r\n**Lemon Glaze:**\r\n- ½ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice\r\n- 2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted\r\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\r\n- 1 lemon, zest finely grated\r\n\r\n**Directions:**\r\n1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\r\n2. Sift together the dry ingredients; the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Using 2 forks or a pastry blender, cut in the butter to coat the pieces with the flour. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs. Fold the blueberries into the batter. Take care not to mash or bruise the blueberries because their strong color will bleed into the dough. Make a well in the center and pour in the heavy cream. Fold everything together just to incorporate; do not overwork the dough.\r\n3. Press the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 12 by 3 by 1¼ inches. Cut the rectangle in ½ then cut the pieces in ½ again, giving you 4 (3-inch) squares. Cut the squares in ½ on a diagonal to give you the classic triangle shape. Place the scones on an ungreased cookie sheet and brush the tops with a little heavy cream. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until beautiful and brown. Let the scones cool a bit before you apply the glaze.\r\n\r\n**Lemon Glaze Instructions:**\r\nYou can make the lemon glaze in a double boiler, or for a simpler alternative, you can zap it in the microwave. Mix the lemon juice with the confectioners' until dissolved in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water for the double-boiler method, or in a microwave-safe bowl. Whisk in the butter and lemon zest. Either nuke the glaze for 30 seconds or continue whisking in the double boiler.
